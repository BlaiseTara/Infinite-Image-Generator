# ---- TODO ----

- Add a setting that stops rendering the pixels until something is actually found, then show them again. I found this to triple the FPS, resulting in faster searching of clusters.

- Make some new Algorithms for detecting images.
  The current algorithm works fine for 2-3 colors, but images arent just blobs of 1 color, they can consist of multiple colors.
  Make a setting to switch between different algorithms for searching for different cluster patterns.

- Maybe make a seperate GUI (tkinter or something) for controlling the settings during runtime
